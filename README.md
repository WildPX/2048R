# 2048R
A mix between the classic 2048 game and rhythm-based mechanics.



## RHYTHM MECHANICS
The Combos & Hits system makes the classic 2048 gameplay more challenging and exciting. The higher your combo count, the more precise you hit notes, and the more squares you merge in one move, the more points you will get. But beware of 2048's rules - strategize wisely to avoid running out of moves. Get in rhythm and enjoy the ride! 

## MAPS
Embark on your journey with five (more in the future!) songs. Can you achieve the perfect run on each of them?

## YOUR FEEDBACK MATTERS
As my first completed game project, I would appreciate any constructive critiques and suggestions.



Stay in rhythm and merge these squares!
